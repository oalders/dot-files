# Auditing Shareable Content

## Overview

**Core principle:** "They have to be able to talk about us without us." - Anil Dash

Effective content is so clear and compelling that others can share it authentically in your absence. This skill provides a systematic audit framework based on Anil Dash's principles for crafting shareable, distinctive messaging.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Reviewing website copy, About pages, feature descriptions
- Writing SEO titles and meta descriptions (these ARE how people share your links)
- Auditing marketing content before publication
- Refining messaging that feels generic or jargon-heavy
- Checking if content is memorable and repeatable

Don't use for:
- Internal technical documentation
- API references or developer guides
- Content that doesn't need to be shared verbally

## The Shareability Audit Checklist

Apply these four tests to every piece of content:

### 1. The Absence Test
**Question:** "Can someone authentically explain this when I'm not there?"

- Read the content aloud - would a community member naturally say this?
- Does it require you to be present to explain or defend it?
- Can someone repeat the key idea in their own words immediately?

**Red flags:** Jargon ("IDE," "leverage," "optimize"), complex sentence structure, requires context to understand

### 2. The Distinctiveness Test
**Question:** "Does this say what only WE can say?"

- Could a competitor copy-paste this and just change the company name?
- Are you using platitudes anyone could claim? ("passionate about innovation," "committed to excellence")
- What's unique and ownable in this message?

**Rule:** If it's not distinctive, delete it. Platitudes dilute your message.

### 3. The Emotional Resonance Test
**Question:** "Is this emotionally gripping or comprehensively technical?"

- Are you overwhelming with details when you should inspire?
- What's the most emotionally resonant aspect? Lead with that.
- Does this connect to values, not just features?

**Example:** "Help race directors focus on what matters—delivering great running events" beats "comprehensive event management IDE that optimizes workflow."

### 4. The Values-First Test
**Question:** "Are values embedded in how people naturally discuss this?"

- Are you leading with jargon or with what you believe?
- Can someone explain your values from reading this?
- Is the value proposition grounded in something concrete and measurable?

**Example:** "the friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams" embeds values directly into natural language.

## Quick Reference - Audit Process

| Step | Action | Pass/Fail |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Read aloud - does it sound natural? | Natural = pass |
| 2 | Remove company name - is it generic? | Unique = pass |
| 3 | Ask "why should I care?" - is answer emotional or technical? | Emotional = pass |
| 4 | Identify the value embedded in language | Present = pass |

**If any test fails:** Rewrite before publishing.

## Common Mistakes

### Using jargon instead of values
❌ "MyMindIsRacing is a comprehensive event management IDE"
✅ "MyMindIsRacing helps race directors focus on what matters"

### Leading with platitudes
❌ "We're passionate about innovation and committed to excellence"
✅ "We make it easy to find and register for local races in seconds"

### Overwhelming with technical details
❌ "Utilizes Claude API with semantic analysis and LLM inference"
✅ "Just paste a link - our AI pulls in all the details automatically"

### Ignoring the "talk about us without us" test
❌ Publishing content that requires you to explain or defend it
✅ Content that community members can authentically share

### SEO keyword stuffing instead of genuine language
❌ "Running Events | Race Calendar | Find Races | Running Event Discovery Platform"
✅ "Find your next race in seconds - local running events, from 5Ks to marathons"

## Verification

Before publishing any content:
1. Read it aloud to someone unfamiliar with your work
2. Ask them to explain it back in their own words
3. If they can't, or if they sound unnatural doing it - rewrite

**Remember:** Repetition and consistency are strength, not weakness. Authentic variation while maintaining core narrative is the goal.
