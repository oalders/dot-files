# Sometimes when I ssh in to a dev environment and try to "git pull" in a
# running tmux session from the previous day, I will not be able to pull,
# because I've connected using a different SSH socket and the environment
# inside tmux env is no longer in sync.

# Update some environment vars in every pane of every window where "bash" is
# the current command. We don't want to send commands to, for instance, a
# running instance of neovim. Run this after logging in for the first time each
# day to prevent having manually to update the tmux env in many different
# workspaces.
